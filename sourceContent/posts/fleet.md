RequestCoin is currently operating in the Ropsten testnet. Let's review each contract individually along with the code for the request miner.

None of this code has been vetted at all. Ideally, we will get them out in the public and perform an audit once we have more traction. If other developers find security risks (they exist for sure), please contact us and we can deploy updates.

As contracts are updated and redeployed, our static site generator will update this site to contain the latest details automatically.
