Pyth.io is currently operating in the Ropsten testnet. Let's review each contract individually along with the code for the request miner.

This code is completely unvetted. Ideally, we will get our contracts out publicly and perform an audit once we have more traction. If other developers find security risks (without a doubt, they exist), please [contact us](/contact) and we can deploy updates.

As contracts are updated and redeployed, our static site generator will update this site to contain the latest details automatically.
