It's good to talk about what we are **not** trying to accomplish *yet*.

**Privacy:** We are *not* looking at privacy in any way, for now. Everything within the realm of **RequestCoin** is 100% public. If you spend the token to get the current price of corn on the blockchain, that transaction along with the actual price of corn is available on the blockchain for everyone.

**Private APIs:** We are assuming, for now, that only public data is fair game. We will not assume that any given node has access to any API that isn't publicly available. This will drastically limit content we can get into the blockchain but for now, simplicity is the key.

**Ethereum:** Only the Ethereum blockchain will be targeted for the first iteration of this product, but there is no reason why others won't be compatible in the future.

**Transparency:** The goal is to be as clear and open with *all* possible information. The sole purpose is to figure out a way to get internet data into the blockchain in a trust-less yet reliable manner. *more will be added here as the project grows and a team is compiled*
