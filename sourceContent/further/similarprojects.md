There are a handful of extremely interesting projects in this space.

[Vitalik Buterin](https://blog.ethereum.org/author/vitalik-buterin/) himself wrote about a decentralized oracle all the way back in 2014 he called [schellingcoin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/).

The most similar, but much more advanced is [ChainLink](https://link.smartcontract.com/). These guys have a tremendous amount of momentum. [ChainLink](https://link.smartcontract.com/) is a complex system of data providers and data proxies that is tightly coupled with financial organizations and big name research organizations. We are very excited to see their work go live.

[Delphi](https://delphi.systems/) is probably the most similar to **Concurrence** in terms of long term goals and product. *We even named our oracle Pyth.io for a while before we saw [their publications](https://keepingstock.net/a-glimpse-of-pythia-731df5fc7972)*. We both hope to build a generalized system for getting decentralized oracle data into the Ethereum blockchain. Everything we do is open source, hopefully our projects will work to enrich each other.

There are also a bunch of good projects working in the prediction market space. This is similar to decentralized oracles because they require a network of clients to verify events. Most notably, [Augur](https://augur.net/) and [Gnosis](https://gnosis.pm/).

[Oraclize](http://www.oraclize.it/) is probably the most well known oracle service. There's a good chance they will look to move to a decentralized model soon. [Here](https://ethereumdev.io/getting-data-internet-oraclize/) is a nice little example of how to use [Oraclize](http://www.oraclize.it/) to fetch the price of Ethereum.

Another oracle that has been around for a while that might be getting on the [decentralized bandwagon](https://medium.com/@edmundedgar/snopes-meets-mechanical-turk-announcing-reality-check-a-crowd-sourced-smart-contract-oracle-551d03468177) is [RealityKeys](https://www.realitykeys.com/).

Recently, [Roman Brodetski](https://github.com/RomanBrodetski) published a good [article](https://medium.com/@roman.brodetski/introducing-oracul-decentralized-oracle-data-feed-solution-for-ethereum-5cab1ca8bb64) about decentralized oracles.

[Here](https://medium.com/@mustwin/building-an-oracle-for-an-ethereum-contract-6096d3e39551) is a good article about different iterations of building an oracle.

The [Truthcoin Whitepaper](http://www.truthcoin.info/papers/truthcoin-whitepaper.pdf) is another old writeup that laid the ground work for decentralized oracles.

[Zap.store](https://zap.store/) looks like another project in this space.

Many smaller projects are emerging that are also helping to enrich the space. For example, [tinyoracle](https://github.com/axic/tinyoracle) is a great little example project for building a baseline oracle.

All projects in this space will work to enrich the value and accuracy by providing more and more disparate sources for off-chain content. In the end, the best way to build an on-chain consensus will be to use a combination of all networks.
