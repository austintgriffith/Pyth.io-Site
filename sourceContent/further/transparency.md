**Transparency:** The goal is to be as clear and open with *all* possible information to gain the trust of possible miners and developers. If anything seems shifty or missing, [contact us right away](/contact). The sole purpose is to figure out a way to get internet data into the blockchain in a trustless yet reliable manner. Right now this entire project has been built by me, <a href="http://austingriffith.com">Austin Griffith M.S. E.E.</a>, a software engineer living in Fort Collins, Colorado. I used the pronoun "we" a lot in this writeup because I don't want to go through and change it all once a few more people join the project and start contributing. But so far, your narrator has been this jabronie:

Please [contact me](/contact) about anything; let's get a dialog about **Concurrence** started!
