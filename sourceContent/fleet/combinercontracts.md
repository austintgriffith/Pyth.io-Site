The **Combiner** contracts are the most dynamic and heady of the fleet. Their job is to traverse **responses** *(bytes32)* from miners and come to a **concurrence** *(bytes32)*. This *agreed upon consensus* is then used to **reward()** and **punish()** miners and is delivered to a developer's final **callback** *(address)* contract.
