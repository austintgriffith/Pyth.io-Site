The **Concurrence** fleet is currently operating in the Ropsten testnet.

<img style="width:100%" src="/images/contracts.svg" />

**Concurrence** **(CCCE)** token is reserved behind a generic **request**. Miners are signaled by the **request** to execute off-chain code and interactions which generate a **response** that they stake token against. Those **responses** are aggregated in **combiner** contracts to draw a deterministic consensus on-chain, reward miners, and trigger developer contracts with the **result**.

------------------------------------------------

### DISCLAIMER:
This code is completely unvetted. Ideally, we will get our contracts out publicly and perform an audit once we have more traction. If other developers find security risks (without a doubt, they exist), please [contact us](/contact) and we can deploy updates.
