It's good to talk about what we are **not** trying to accomplish *yet*.

**Privacy:** We are *not* looking at privacy in any way, for now. Everything within the realm of **RequestCoin** is 100% public. If you spend the token to get the current price of corn on the blockchain, that transaction along with the actual price of corn is available on the blockchain for everyone.

**Private APIs:** We are assuming that only public data is fair game. We will not assume that any given node has access to any API that isn't publicly available. This will drastically limit content we can get into the blockchain but for now, simplicity is the key.

**Ethereum:** Only the Ethereum blockchain will be targeted for the first iteration of this product, but there is no reason why others won't be compatible in the future.

**Transparency:** The goal is to be as clear and open with *all* possible information to gain the trust of possible miners and developers. If anything seems shifty or missing, [contact us right away](/contact). The sole purpose is to figure out a way to get internet data into the blockchain in a trustless yet reliable manner. It needs to be stated that **this project is not geared toward profit and hopes to be as open and clear with all information as possible**. Right now this entire project has been built by me, Austin Griffith M.S. E.E., a software engineer living in Fort Collins, Colorado. I used the pronoun "we" a lot in this writeup because I don't want to go through and change it all once a few more people join the project and start contributing. But so far, your narrator has been this jabronie:

Please [contact me](/contact) me about anything; let's get a dialog about RequestCoin started!

**ICO:** Let's wait until *we* get some traction and our working product is solid. In the long run it's probably not ever going to be something we try.
