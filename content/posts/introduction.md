Blockchain technologies, smart contracts in particular, are incredibly powerful and are poised to disrupt many aspects of finance, business, and law. However, due to the deterministic and decentralized nature of smart contracts, they are unable to communicate directly with valuable data sources on the internet.

An oracle provides that link by making off-chain requests and delivering results on-chain. Unfortunately, only centralized oracles exist today and contracts are forced to rely on a single point of failure which could easily be attacked, manipulated, and corrupted.

**A decentralized, trust-less network of incentivized oracles is needed to empower the next generation of smart contracts.**

With the correct cryptoeconomics in place, a statistically adequate supply of miners will request information from multiple internet sources and, in combination with the staking of a token, reach a blind consensus off-chain. Then, efficiently inscribe the data onto the blockchain, available publicly for smart contract logic and execution.

The **RequestCoin** network will provide the raw middleware between Ethereum and the greater internet by allowing contracts to signal for data which will trigger miners to retrieve the information, reach a truthful consensus, and deliver it back to the blockchain. The miners will, in turn, receive a token reward originally reserved by the requesting contract.
