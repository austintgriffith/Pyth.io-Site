[Solidity Docs](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/solidity-by-example.html) should probably be your first stop when learning smart contracts.

[Consensys](https://consensys.net/) has a bunch of resources on their website and [github](https://github.com/ConsenSys) including their [Smart Contract Best Practices](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices).

[OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.org/) has a github that is full of [hardened and tested contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts).

[Decypher Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CB0ZkvogP7tnCTDR-zV7g/videos) is an awesome feed of videos put together by [Jordan Leigh](https://twitter.com/alwaysbcoding)
