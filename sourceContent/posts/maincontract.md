The **Main** contract keeps a **contract** *(address)* for any **id** *(uint32)*. This allows for old contracts to be replaced with better versions while keeping the main contract address the same.

<!--RQC CODE solidity Main/Main.sol -->

Current address:
<!--RQC ADDRESS Main/Main.address -->

Current ABI:
<!--RQC ABI Main/Main.abi -->
