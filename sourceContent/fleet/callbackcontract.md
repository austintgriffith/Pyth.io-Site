The **Callback** contract is simply a placeholder for examples. Normally, when a consensus has been reached, a call to the developer's contract is made with the final **concurrence**. But, for demonstration purposes, we'll feed results to this contract for safe keeping.

<!--RQC CODE solidity Callback/Callback.sol -->

Current address:
<!--RQC ADDRESS Callback/Callback.address -->

Current ABI:
<!--RQC ABI Callback/Callback.abi -->
