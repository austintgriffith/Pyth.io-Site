Blockchain technologies, smart contracts in particular, are incredibly powerful and are poised to disrupt many aspects of finance, business, and law. However, due to the deterministic and decentralized nature of smart contracts, they are unable to communicate directly with valuable data sources off-chain.

An oracle provides that link by making off-chain interactions and delivering results on-chain. Unfortunately, only centralized oracles exist today and contracts are forced to rely on a single point of failure which could be attacked, manipulated, or corrupted.

**A decentralized, trustless network of incentivized oracles is needed to empower the next generation of smart contracts.**

With the correct cryptoeconomics at play, a statistically adequate supply of miners will, in combination with the staking of a token, reach a consensus off-chain. Then, efficiently inscribe the data onto the blockchain, available publicly for developers to drive their smart contract logic.

**This is not a new idea.** Vitalik even posted about <a target='_blank' href='https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/'>SchellingCoin</a> back in 2014.

What makes **Concurrence** different from other projects in this space is *raw simplicity*, *complete transparency*, and *full decentralization*.

**Concurrence is a smart contract fleet that broadcasts *generic* requests from developers and draws a consensus from simple answers received from a decentralized swarm of miners. The complexity is deferred to the miners and how they decided to handle requests. This off-chain miner code will evolve quickly while the on-chain contracts harden.**

**Concurrence needs a community.** We need developers to wire their Dapps into our testnet fleet, a swarm of miners running our code to make requests, and eyes on our code/contracts before the ecosystem is stable enough for real use.
