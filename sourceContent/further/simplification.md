It's good to talk about what we are **not** trying to accomplish *yet*.

**Privacy:** We are *not* looking at privacy in any way, for now. Everything within the realm of **Concurrence** is 100% public. If you spend the token to get the current price of corn on the blockchain, that transaction along with the actual price of corn is available on the blockchain for everyone.

**Security:** This fleet of contracts, and the code written to interact with it, is not ready for prime time. There are probably major issues in the code base. Please! [Help us](/contact) improve the platform.
