The **Concurrence** fleet is currently operating in the Ropsten testnet. Smart contract developers reserve **(CCCE)** token for a generic **request**. Miners are signaled by the **request** events to execute off-chain code and generate a **response** on which they stake **(CCCE)** token. Those **responses** are aggregated in **combiners** to draw a deterministic consensus on-chain, reward good actors, and deliver the **concurrence** to developer contracts.

### DISCLAIMER:
This code is completely unvetted. Ideally, we will get our contracts out publicly and perform an audit once we have more traction. If other developers find security risks (without a doubt, they exist), please [contact us](/contact) and we can deploy updates.
