The miner is written in javascript and will soon be release as an open source <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a> package that can be installed and launched.

Eventually, an <a href="https://electron.atom.io/" target="_blank">Electron</a> app will be deployed and users across operating systems will simply download the app and start mining requests without any development knowledge.

We are also looking into distributing miners as small pieces of stand-alone hardware that can simply be plugged in to any existing network.

The miner code is, so far, very rough and almost completely untested. We should caution against running it for now.
