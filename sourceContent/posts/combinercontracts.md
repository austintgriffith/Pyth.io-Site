The **Combiner** contracts are the most dynamic. In fact, they can even be written and deployed by a third party. Their job is to capture responses from miners, deliver rewards to good actors, and come to a consensus. External contracts will also then communicate with the respective combiner contracts to retrieve mined, internet data.
