Initially, contracts will be very malleable, freezable, and quickly replaced. But, as the fleet becomes more stable and more secure, a system of token stake will take power and no single account will be able to control the governance of the network.

For instance, at first, certain parameters and even basic functionality will change rapidly. But, as stability and the community behind the network grows, a governance contract (called Auth for now) powered by a voting democracy will replace the dictatorship of a single acting despot.
