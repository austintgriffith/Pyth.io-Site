This exploration should start from the ground up. We want anyone to be able to spin up a vanilla linux machine and build out an entire miner and contract deployment system from scratch. We also want to explore basic Ethereum network interactions including the transferring of funds, simple contract deployment, and eventually more advanced contract mechanics.

**This section will act as a sandbox as we explore smart contract concepts.**

If you want to get down to the brass tacks of the system, skip ahead to the [Fleet](/fleet/).
